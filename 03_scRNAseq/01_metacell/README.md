### Metacell scRNA-seq pipeline (Zenodo)

Large files required for the Metacell-based scRNA-seq analysis are archived on Zenodo (DOI: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18390360>).

The file `scRNAseq_analysis.tar.gz` contains a complete, self-contained Metacell pipeline, including: - 10x Genomics input matrices for multiple samples - Cell hashing / ClickTag metadata - Custom helper functions and analysis scripts - Precomputed Metacell objects, graphs, annotations, and reference atlases (`mc_db/`)

These files exceed GitHub size limits and are provided via Zenodo to enable full reproducibility of the Metacell analysis presented in this repository.
