# Seurat-based scRNA-seq Analysis

This directory contains all R scripts used for the Seurat-based analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data in this study.

The analysis includes data loading, quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, cell type annotation, and downstream analyses.\
Large input files and processed objects are not stored here and are instead available via Zenodo.

## Data Availability

All required input data and processed objects (e.g. Seurat `.rds` files, count matrices, metadata) are available at:

**Zenodo DOI:** <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18390360>

These files are required to fully reproduce the analyses in this directory.

## Directory Contents

This folder includes: - R script implementing the Seurat workflow, rendered Markdown and/or HTML reports , and figures generated by this script.

## Analysis Overview

The Seurat workflow implemented here generally follows these steps:

1.  Loading raw or preprocessed scRNA-seq count data
2.  Quality control and filtering of low-quality cells
3.  Data normalization and identification of variable features
4.  Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP)
5.  Cell clustering and visualization
6.  Cell type annotation using known marker genes
7.  Differential expression and downstream analyses

Exact parameters and implementation details are documented within the scripts and reports.

Paths should be adjusted.

## Reproducibility Notes

-   Analyses were performed in **R** using the **Seurat** package and associated dependencies.
-   Script execution order is documented in the rendered reports where relevant.
-   Package versions and session information are provided in the analysis outputs when applicable.
