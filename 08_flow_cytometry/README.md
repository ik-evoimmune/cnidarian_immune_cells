# Flow Cytometry Analyses

This directory contains the analysis workflows for all conventional flow cytometry experiments performed in this study.

These analyses were used to quantify immune cell properties and functional responses across experimental conditions.

## Analyses included

-   **Viability assays**  
    Quantification of live and dead cell populations following treatments or perturbations.

-   **Apoptosis assays**  
    Measurement of apoptotic cell fractions using fluorescence-based markers.

-   **Reporter line quantification**  
    Analysis of reporter-positive cell frequencies and signal intensities across conditions.

-   **Phagocytosis assays**  
    Quantification of phagocytic activity based on flow cytometry uptake measurements.
