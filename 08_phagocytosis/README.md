# Phagocytosis Analysis

This directory contains the R script used to analyze and visualize phagocytosis assay data across multiple experimental conditions and cell fractions.  
The analysis includes statistical testing (ANOVA, post-hoc comparisons, and pairwise t-tests) and generation of publication-ready figures showing individual replicates together with summary statistics (mean ± SD).

## Data availability

The raw phagocytosis assay data used as input for this analysis are deposited in a public Zenodo repository:
